#### TODO
* Make a simple test function to test (all) scenarios in reliable transport with ACK's and big messages.
* Implementing full code for splitting messages + refine.
* Thoroughly testing ACK's (for now it seems to work reasonably.)
* Thoroughly testing splitting bigger messages.


#### Done
* Implementing ACK's using STOP-AND-WAIT protocol for all messages except routing and broadcasts.
* Base code implemented for splitting messages and assembling them.
* Some basic testing
